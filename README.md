# One Time Pad (OTP) Encryption in C

This repository contains an implementation of the One Time Pad (OTP) encryption technique in the C programming language.

## Branches

This project has separate branches for different operating systems:
- **Windows Version**: [windows-encrypt](https://github.com/juacu7340/otpc/tree/windows-encrypt)
- **Linux Version**: [linux-encrypt](https://github.com/juacu7340/otpc/tree/linux-encrypt)

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create a cross-platform OTP library in C.
This project serves as an experimental platform to explore various implementation approaches and measure their performance impacts.
